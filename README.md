# PyBer Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to break down the data in order to be able to determine the total fares by city type. We would calculate the fare prices for each month and by the types of city such as rural, suburban, and urban to make a DataFrame. We used Matplotlib to make a final multiple-line graph with the data we organized. 

## Results:
### Total Summary Information

The results we got for this project is that Urban cities dominated the other city types in total rides by a huge amount. This led the Urban cities to make more money in total fares, but also leading them to having the lowest average fare per driver since they had a lot of drivers working there.

### Fares Per City Type

The chart shows that there was a rise in total fares for every city type in late February/ early March. Also Urban cities are the leader in total fares followed by suburban cities and rural cities at the bottom. Towards the ens of the chart in April, suburban cities start to rise in total fares while rural and urban cities show a decrease.

## Summary:
Three business recommendations I would give are that:
1) Since there is a higher supply of drivers than jobs(total rides) in rural cities, it would be beneficial to try to find a way to maybe focus more on them or even incentivize drivers to work in rural areas where rides are almost twice larger then drivers.
2) If the CEO were willing to focus more on Urban cities, maybe having promos and more advertising could help, especially in the smaller cities with less riders where the average fare per driver tends to be super high. They can try to make the promos be more appealing to the specific target.
3) Also from April to May the CEO could use more of the companys resources to advertise in Urban and Rural cities since those two seem to be on the decline while Suburban is rapidly increasing.
