# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to break down the data in order to be able to determine the total fares by city type. We would calculate the fare prices for each month and by the types of city such as rural, suburban, and urban to make a DataFrame. We used Matplotlib to make a final multiple-line graph with the data we organized. 

## Results:

The results we got for this project is that Urban cities dominated the other city types in total rides by a huge amount. This led the Urban cities to make more money in total fares, but also leading them to having the lowest average fare per driver since they had a lot of drivers working there.
